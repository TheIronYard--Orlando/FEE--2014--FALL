Source control, revision control, version control... all mean the same thing. Git is one of many diff types of such systems. It keeps track of file changes and lets you know what's different.

Github is the web app, the pretty interface for git (the underlying system).

## Commits
aka *check point*
> Robot, remember the state of these files forever, what's been added (green)/deleted (red),  at this point in time.

**Messages**: journal what you're about to change. This is how you demonstrate progress to David.

Remember to commit after you check off todos.
