## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> cd
$> cd ..
$> pwd
$> man
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
$> git init
$> git add
$> git commit -m
$> git push
$> git status
$> git checkout <<branch name>>
$> git push origin <<branch name>>
```
