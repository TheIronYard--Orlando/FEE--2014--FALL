## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

* The `ls` command lists files in your current location (directory).

```shell
$> pwd
```

* `pwd` displays your current location.

```shell
$> cd / 
$> cd ~
$> cd ..
$> cd - 
```

* The `cd` command is used to change directories.
