## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```


* The `ls` command... (list files in current directory using long format)


cd dir – Change directory to dir
cd – Change to home
mkdir dir – Create a directory dir
pwd – Show current directory
reset - clears terminal
