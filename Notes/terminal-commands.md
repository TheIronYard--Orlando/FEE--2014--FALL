## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

* The `ls` command... (fill in the blanks)

The `ls` command is list
The `ls-A` command is list all include hidden files
The `ls-Al` command is displaying long format files
The `ls-Alh` command list files and folders

```shell
$> cd - # go to home directory
$> cd - # go to last directory you were in
$> firefox - # starts firefox
$> man - # Get instructions for a particular Unix command or a bit of Unix. Use space to get next page and q to exit.
$> pwd - # show current working directory
$> rm - # delete remove file
```
