## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls  (list the contents of a particular directory)
$> ls -A  (
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

$> cd  (returns to home directory)
$> cd directory  (takes you to the name directory)
$> cd ..  (takes you up one directory)

$> pwd  (shows you what directory you're currently in)

$> curl -o file.ext http://www.example.com  (allows you to download a file from a particular location)
