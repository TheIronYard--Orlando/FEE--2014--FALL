## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

* The `ls` command list files in your current location

The `ls-A` command is list all include hidden files
The `ls-Al` command is displaying long format files
The `ls-Alh` command list files and folders

```shell
$> cd 
$> pwd
$> man
```
* The `cd` command changes directories 
* The `pwd` command displays your current location
