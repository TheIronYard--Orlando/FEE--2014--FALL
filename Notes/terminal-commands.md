## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

* `ls` lists the files in the current working directory
* `ls -A` lists invisible files (i.e. dotfiles)
* `ls -Al` lists extra information about the files in the current working directory. Things like: permissions, file size, time of last modification, etc


```shell
$> pwd
```

* `pwd` aka *where am I*? prints the working directory

```shell
$> cd
```

* `cd` changes directory
