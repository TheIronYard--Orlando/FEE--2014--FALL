## Terminal commands that we've learned so far (and some explanation)...

```shell
$> # <- Look, it's just like your prompt!
```

Those three backticks tells Github to display a code block... The word `shell` after the backticks tells Github what _kind_ of code block it is (for highlighting purposes). Remember to check the [Github Flavored Markdown documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

```shell
$> ls
$> ls -A
$> ls -Al
$> ls -Alh
```

* The `ls` command... (fill in the blanks)
* lists what you're searching for, like you're looking inside a certain director. 
```
$> ls downloads
```
for example, will list all the files in the 'Downloads' folder on your mac. 

```shell
$> q
```
when you want to exit a block of information you might have searched for, like when you're done reading help text in the terminal and want to return to the prompt line. 
```
$> clear
```
Clears the terminal of previous commands so you have an empty screen to look at
