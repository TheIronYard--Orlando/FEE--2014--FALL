### In _your_ `TIY-Assignments` repo:

* Invite me as a Collaborator (under "Settings/Collborators").
* Create a _blue_ Label called "Ready for Review"
* Create _gray_ Labels for T-Shirt size estimates: S, M, L, XL, XXL
* Create an Issue for each assignment _as you begin one_. No pre-emptive strikes.
* Open a PR appropriately and link it to your WIP issue.

### For each assignment:

* Break each assignment down into checkboxes as necessary; review with me.
* Estimate the assignment as a whole in T-Shirt sizes and apply the appropriate label; review with me.
* Estimate the major pieces of the assignment in points -- 1, 3, 5, 8, 13 -- and add them to the Issue; review with me.
* Estimate the smaller pieces of the assignment _as necessary_; review with me.
* Work in Pomodoro cycles of 25 minutes; commit _at least_ every break.
* Push your commits into Github _every 3 hours_.

### Turn-in instructions:

* Follow the same process for in-class turn-ins: open a PR, 2 :+1:'s, then merge.
* _Every weekday_: check in via HipChat at 08:10, standup at 09:30, retro at 15:30; do not be late.

### Important!

* Call for help via HipChat if you encounter a blocker. **Don't go more than 1 Pomodoro (25 min) stuck on something!**
