* Reset your `[username].github.io` _and_ `TIY-Assignments` repo a la [Shake it Off](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/master/Assignments/04--Shake-it-off.md
  * Create a new branch in Github from your current `master` branch
  * Push that branch into Github
  * Reset `master` back to the first commit
* Build a _simple_ Jekyll theme for your site that matches The Iron Yard's Tumblr theme using HTML and CSS (kinda like [Build a Blog](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/master/Assignments/19--Build-a-Blog.md). 
* Document _all the tags and style rules_ that you use to build your theme in `Docs/CSS.md` and `Docs/HTML.md` in your `TIY-Assignments` repository, like all the other documentation assignments.
