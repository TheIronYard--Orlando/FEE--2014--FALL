* Reset your `[username].github.io` **and** `TIY-Assignments` repo a la [Shake it Off](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/master/Assignments/04--Shake-it-off.md
  * Create a new branch in Github from your current `master` branch
  * Push that branch into Github
  * Reset `master` back to the first commit
* Build a _simple_ Jekyll theme for your site that matches [The Iron Yard's Tumblr theme](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr/longform/) using HTML and CSS (kinda like [Build a Blog](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/master/Assignments/19--Build-a-Blog.md).
  * Create a branch named `a-new-hope` in your `[username].github.io` repo
  * Commit your changes to the `a-new-hope` branch
  * Open a Pull Request from `a-new-hope` to `master` and link it to your WIP issue
  * Instead of Jekyll, use [Hexo](http://hexo.io), a drop-in replacement for Jekyll written in Node JS.
* Document _all the tags and style rules_ that you use to build your theme in `Docs/CSS.md` and `Docs/HTML.md` in your `TIY-Assignments` repository, like all the other documentation assignments.
* Selectively merge your `_posts/` directory from the renamed `master` branch.
