### Objectives

Demonstrate understanding of:

* desktop-first Responsive Web Design principles
* CSS media query breakpoints based on a reference implementation
* the cascading principle of CSS

Reinforce understanding of:

* HTML block and inline elements
* CSS display and box-model style rules

### Directions

Using [the Longform theme](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr/longform/) and [The Iron Yard blogs](http://blog.theironyard.com) as reference, refactor the CSS for your blog theme to be responsive; only adjust the HTML _as absolutely necessary_. You should create a new branch on _both_ your `[username].github.io` and `TIY-Assignments` repositories called `rwd-strikes-back`. You should have _two_ PRs for this assignment.

* Create a branch in _both_ repos called `rwd-strikes-back` and commit your work into those.
* Create a folder in your `TIY-Assignments` repository called `02--The-RWD-Strikes-Back` to put your work in.
* Use the Chrome Developer Tools to identify the breakpoints _precisely_ from the reference implementations.
* Use Skitch to capture screen shots at each breakpoint and identify differences from the "desktop" version...
  * Save each file named according to the breakpoint, e.g. `max-480px.jpg`, `min-1024px,jpg`
  * Commit the files into your `TIY-Assignments` repository.
* Refactor your CSS to make your layout match the reference implementations at each breakpoint.
* Work in Pomodoros, commit _at least_ every break, more often is better.
* Assign the "Ready to Review" label to your issues as they're ready for me to review.

Practice putting flags in the sand: create your issues and branches, _commit something_ to your branch, and open a PR for that branch _immediately_. Make checkboxes for yourself on your WIP issue, and check them off in between Pomodoros.
