 *
 * Consider a finite 3x3 board of cells:
 *
 *     0   1   2
 *   +---+---+---+
 * 0 |   |   |   |
 *   +---+---+---+
 * 1 |   |   |   |
 *   +---+---+---+
 * 2 |   |   |   |
 *   +---+---+---+
 *
 * Represented as:
 *
 * board = [
 *   [ false, false, false ],
 *   [ false, false, false ],
 *   [ false, false, false ],
 * ]
 *
 * Where each Boolean value represents the state of a `cell`, either
 * alive (`true`) or dead (`false`). Each cell can be accessed with
 * the index operators (`[n]`), e.g. `board[0][1]`, `board[2][2]`.
 *
 * Write a function called `conway` that...
 *
 * - GIVEN the state of a `cell` and a list of neighboring cells...
 * - THEN returns the state of the `cell` with the rules applied.
 *
 * Write a function called `neighborsOf` that...
 *
 * - GIVEN a `board` and `row` and `col` coordinates...
 * - THEN returns a list of the neighboring cells.
 *
 * Write a function called `tick` that...
 *
 * - GIVEN a `board`...
 * - THEN returns a NEW `board` representing the next generation.
 *
 * Use the provided `board` function to produce the initially empty
 * board, and test the following starting positions:
 *
