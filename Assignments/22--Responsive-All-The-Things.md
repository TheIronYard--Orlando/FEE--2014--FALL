### Review

Today we talked about [Responsive Web Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design), looked at [Sam Kapila's RWD checklist](http://samkap.github.io/projects/tiy-rwd/) (thanks @samkap!) and other resources, and added [CSS media queries](http://j.mp/1oWBZKd) to [our Vertical Timeline implementation](/Dojos/2014-10-28/vertical-timeline.html) via [`@media` rules](http://j.mp/1oWDnwh).

### Responsive All the Things!

* Complete the refactor of [my Vertical Timeline](/Dojos/2014-10-28/vertical-timeline.html) to make it _fully responsive_ per [the reference implementation](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/VerticalTimeline/).
* Apply these principles to your [Nested Accordion](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/NestedAccordion/) and [Horizontal Dropdown Menu](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/HorizontalDropDownMenu/)
