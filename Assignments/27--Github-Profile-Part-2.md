### Review

We looked at some more of the jQuery API -- `click()`, `parent()`, `siblings()` and `each()` (very briefly) -- refactored our `ajax()` code into [the jQuery Promise API](http://api.jquery.com/?s=promise): `then()`, `done()`, `fail()`, etc. We built the clickable tabs together with jQuery so that you'd have a reference implementation; but you should probably use the Bootstrap JavaScript component instead, which uses jQuery (maybe you could check it out). 
### Assignment

For tonight, you'll need to review the DOM Events API in JavaScript, HTML `<form>` elements, and the various HTTP verbs that are used to build an API. We'll be using a _lot_ of them.

#### Reading

* Document the following in your own words:
  * Form Elements from the [MDN HTML Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
    * include HTML examples for each element _and_ `type` variant
    * include pertinent attributes and specifically the event handler attribtues
  * [Web Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)
    * include an example of the user interaction that would trigger each event in the browser
    * _only_ cover the "standard" events; _omit_ any browser-specific additions
    * cover all form and input device events
  * HTTP Verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE -- start with [What is Rest?](http://j.mp/what-is-rest)
    * provide 3 examples of each verb being used in the Github API
    
#### Coding

FINISH YOUR GITHUB PROFILE! We'll need this as a solid base for the next module!
