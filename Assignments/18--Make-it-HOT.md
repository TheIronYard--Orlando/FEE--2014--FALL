### Review

Today we learned about some new CSS rules, The Cascade, basic selectors, and different kinds of units used in CSS. We reviewed a bunch of block-level tags, some basic attributes, and how to add CSS into your page. Tonight, you'll research inline tags (also called "elements"), more attributes, and more CSS rules.

#### Resources

* [HTML5 Tags on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)
* [CSS3 Rules on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)
* [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com)

#### Reading

* Add 10 more tags with 3 examples each to your `Reading-HTML.md` file.
* Add 10 more CSS rules with 3 examples to your `Reading-CSS.md` file.
  * This time look for `font`- and `text`-affecting rules (hint hint).
* Continue practicing with [CodeSchool: Frontend Foundations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations)
* Continue reading [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com)

CodeSchool and Learn Layout should be complete by the end of the week.

#### Skitch this Website

* [Download and Install Skitch](http://evernote.com/skitch/)
* Use Skitch to take a screenshot of [The Iron Yard -- Orlando site](http://orlando.theironyard.com)
* Annotate the snapshot with some boxes and labels of what you would call the various areas of the page, like I did in class.
* Export the file to your `TIY-Assignments` repo as `Skitch-this-Website.png`; `git status && git add && git commit`
* Open the Dev Tools Inspector in Chrome and see what the parts _actually_ look like.
* Update your screenshot with the _real_ tags used; add boxes in another color, if necessary.
* Export on top of the same file; `git status && git add && git commit`
* Push to Github and _compare_ the differences between those two commits.

Alternately, you can use [the Evernote webclipper](https://evernote.com/webclipper/guide/) if you prefer. The outcome should be the same, though.
