## TodoMVC -- All About User Stories

### Example User Stories

#### EPIC: I can create a list of todos so that...

* I can keep track of what I need to do next.
* I can track what I have already done.
* I can track important due dates.
* I can stay out of trouble.
* I can manage my time better.

----

#### I can _add a task to the list_ to that I can _be reminded to do it_.

----

#### I can _mark an incomplete task as completed_ so that I can _track what has been done_.

* Click a button to mark the task as complete; what does that look like?
* Can I change my mind and mark it as incomplete again?
* Strikethough on text would be a neat effect...

----

#### I can _view a list of incomplete tasks_ so that I can _pick what I need to do next_.

----

#### I can _remove tasks from the list_ so that I can _keep my list clean_.

* Click a button on each item to remove it; confirm first?
* Can I get it back after I remove it? Trash can vs black hole of death?
* Can I remove more than one item at a time? All completed items?

----

#### I can _change a task on the list_ so that I can _fix my typos and be more specific about them_.
