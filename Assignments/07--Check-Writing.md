  * Pair up using Ping-Pong, remember to commit frequently and switch pairs so both partners have code.
  * **Red-Green-Refactor!** Write tests first!
* Conway's Game of Life:
  * Implement a simple function named `conway(cell, neighbors)` that...
    * Given the state of its `neighbors`
    * Returns the state of `cell` after 1 tick
  * Test-driven is preferred, just like I did in class.
