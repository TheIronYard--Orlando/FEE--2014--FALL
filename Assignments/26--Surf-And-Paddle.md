### Review

The group retrospective led seamlessly into the topics of the day: git workflow and working in groups. We also took a brief look at the project that became Kevin and Carlos' new best friend, Bootstrap.

### Resources

* [Bootstrap: ](http://getbootstrap.com)
* [Git Flow](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow)
* [Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) -- supported by the Git extensions above
* [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com/) -- Meditate on what is possible with nothing but CSS.

### [Surf and Paddle](https://a4a9af4a2e802671f00b4af7d94a218d2d71be32.googledrive.com/host/0B_9V0tR7amAncWVCbGNEZUhXYmM/surf_and_paddle.html)

A rite of passage at The IronYard, this won't be the hardest CSS layout you've ever tackled. Use it as an opportunity to practice what you've learned about CSS, split tasks among your team members, and apply a reasonable git workflow to help avoid train wrecks.

Aim for pixel perfect (except the break points, which can be different from David's especially if you use Bootstrap); due 8am Thursday
