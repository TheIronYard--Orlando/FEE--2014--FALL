### Review

Today we developed the Horizontal Dropdown Menu a little more, expanding the mobile-first layout into two more view sizes, which allowed us to explore `float`, `position`, and more box-model concepts. We also learned about CSS transitions with the `transition` property, and I showed you some magic incantations to serve files locally via the JavaScript task runner `gulp`.

### [Horizontal Slide Out Menu](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/HorizontalSlideOutMenu/)

This should seem eerily similar to the [Horizontal Dropdown Menu](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/HorizontalDropDownMenu/) in bits and pieces, because it is, but it's also enough different to drive you nuts. Use all your skills and the tools provided to produce a _pixel perfect_ implementation.

### [Responsive Product Grid Layout](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ProductGridLayout/)

Okay, not gonna lie, you haven't tackled anything like this. Yet. But you have all the tools: CSS transitions, floats and positioning, lots of HTML, some JavaScript click event handlers. You can do it. If you work together.
