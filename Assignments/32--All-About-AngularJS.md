### Review

Today we looked at more Angular JS built-in Directives -- `ng-form`, `ng-submit` -- the `factory()` method, and how Angular handles Dependency Injection. I showed you some uses for the `$http` Service, and we added some more functionality to [our TodoMVC implementation in Angular JS](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/Dojos/2014-11-18/).

### [Shaping Up with Angular JS](http://j.mp/codeschool--angularjs)

Now that you've at least _seen_ all the levels and correct answers, work through Levels 1 through 3 on your own tonight. Don't worry if you get stuck, just buy the answer, type it in, and move on. You'll practice some more tomorrow night. Try to spend no more than an hour on this part of the assignment (timebox FTW!) so you have time for the rest.

### Angular JS Documentation -- Your Way

Complete your documentation from last night; add the following pieces:

* directives
  * `form` -- you got it
  * `input` -- and all variants [[1]](#footnotes)
  * `select`
  * `textarea`
  * `ngBlur`
  * `ngChange`
  * `ngChecked`
  * `ngFocus`
* services
  * `$controller`
  * `$http`
  * `$interpolate`
  
### Not another Github Profile!

Knowing what you do now of Angular JS, Modules, Controllers, Expressions, and the `$http` service, rip all that jQuery junk out of your Github Profile! Get the profile column on the left working with Angular JS Expressions and a simple `$http` call to pull the JSON data from your local file.

### Hello, [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)!

Read through the documentation for Restangular, add it to your Github Profile project and wire it up using the [Quick Configuration (For Lazy Readers)](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular#quick-configuration-for-lazy-readers). Try replacing your `$http` calls with Restangular.

### :musical_note: We Jammin'... Jammin'... :musical_note: 

Use the TodoMVC project to experiment with the features of Angular JS, refer to [the Angular JS example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angularjs) when you get stuck. And you _will_ get stuck. This is a learning exercise, not a graded exercise. Tomorrow we do something completely different.

1. Too bad you don't have a handy form lying around with all those field types on it...
