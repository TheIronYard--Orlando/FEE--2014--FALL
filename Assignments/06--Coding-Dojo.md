* Coding Dojo
  * [ ] Select a pairing partner whose skill level differs from you
  * [ ] Clone your `TIY-Assignments` repository locally or in C9
  * [ ] Pick a workstation to start pairing on (or join your partner's workstation)
  * [ ] Checkout a new branch based on `master` called `06--Coding-Dojo`
  * [ ] Create a file called `dojo--2014-09-30.js`
  * [ ] Copy the problem from below into the head of your file.
  * [ ] Every 5 mins, commit using your Github names as the commit message, e.g. `@al-the-x & @bgates` (set a timer?)
  * [ ] After an hour, switch workstations and start over.
  * [ ] Open a PR in _both_ repos; link the PR to your assignment issue.
  * [ ] Also link your _partner's_ PR... You're buddies, after all.
* Reading MORE JavaScript!
  * In the same branch as your dojo...
  * [ ] Add to your `Reading-Javascript.md` file some more examples of JavaScript that you recognize from JS Roadtrip 1 _and_ 2.
  * [ ] You need 10 more (unique) examples and should include conditionals, loops, and lists (arrays).


```javascript
/**
 * String Calculator
 *
 * Given two strings that represent numbers in English -- "one", "two", "three" -- 
 * calculate the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of those numbers
 * and return that value as a `Number`. For example:
 *
 * add("one", "one") === 2
 *
 * For complete credit, provide test coverage for all numbers "zero" through "ten"
 * for at least _two_ operations, but keep in mind that the assignment is designed
 * to enforce _practice_ not _completeness_. Follow "red-green-refactor", use
 * ping-pong pairing, and commit often using `@username & @username` as the
 * commit message.
