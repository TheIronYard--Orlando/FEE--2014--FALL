### Review

Today we talked about the differences between block-level and inline-level HTML elements, looked at a bunch more CSS rules, and wandered around the box model with `width` and `height`, `margin`, `padding`, and `border` rules. We also discovered the power of `float` (just a little) and started picking apart [The Iron Yard Orlando website](http://orlando.theironyard.com).

### Reading

* Due by Friday:
    * [Code School: Frontend Foundations](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/front-end-foundations)
    * [Learn Layout](http://learnlayout.com/)
* 10 more combined additions between HTML and CSS rules:
    * Focus on CSS layout rules like `float`, `clear`, and `position` and HTML tags like `form` and `input`.
    * Include information on the attributes the tags recognize and the valid values the rules expect.

### Build a Blog

* Using [the starting point provided](/Dojos/2014-10-22.html), build out the rest of [The Iron Yard Orlando site](http://orlando.theironyard.com) _as simply as possible_. **Avoid the temptation to look at the source.**
* There may be more markup needed than what we covered in class (but not much more).
* Don't kill yourself or your evening on the rounded border around the logo; we'll cover that tomorrow.
* Commit often! Pair up frequently!
* Make your own checkboxes!
