### Let's have a `mocha`...!

* [Install `mocha` via `npm`](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#installation)
* Pair up for at least 2 hours:
    * Commit incrementally using your Github names as a _prefix_ to your commit message
    * Ensure both pairs have code before you finish
* Rewrite your Coding Dojo examples using the `mocha` helpers:
    * BDD: `describe()`, `it()`, etc
    * TDD: `suite()`, `test()`, etc
* Run your tests _while you refactor_; don't wait until you're "done"!
* Don't you think that you should have a branch? Maybe a PR would be nice?

### Feel like a `chai`...?

* [Install `chai` via `npm`](http://chaijs.com/guide/installation/)
* Pair up for at least 2 hours _with someone else_: do that `@mention` commit thingy
* Refactor your rewritten katas to use `chai` instead of the built-in `assert` module
* Attempt one or more tests in a different style:
    * [Good ole `assert`](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#assert)
    * [I `expect` that you will...](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#expect)
    * [You `should` really behave...](http://chaijs.com/guide/styles/#should)
* What about that branching thing? You've heard of Pull Requests?

### Playing with new ideas...

* Read through the [MDN documentation on JavaScript Array Methods](http://j.mp/1t36RKf)
    * Translate each one using English and maybe some examples.
    * Retype [the multidimensional array example](http://j.mp/1t37hAo)
    * Write a series of steps that adjust the array to look like [the Catalan Opening: Closed Variation](http://j.mp/1BSJj9W)
    * Write tests that verify that your "board" looks correctly at every step.
* Rewrite your katas using your new skills:
    * "Check Writing" should implement a `toEnglish()` function that translates `Number` to `String` in a single step
    * "String Calculator" should implement a `fromEnglish()` function that translates `String` to `Number` in a single step
    * "Conway's Game of Life" should utilize _only_ `Array` methods.
* Tackle at least _two_ [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/problems) from the 1 - 10 series; avoid prime number problems. :D
