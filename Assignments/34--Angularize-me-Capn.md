### Review

Today we covered _a lot_:

* [Domain Modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model), [Service-Oriented Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), and more MVC concepts.
* Unit testing Angular applications with [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html), [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), and our old friends, [Mocha](http://mochajs.org), and [Chai](http://chaijs.com)
* [Mocking](http://j.mp/1uYFfoQ) API requests via [`ngMock.$httpBackend`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/service/$httpBackend) ([more on Mock Objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object))
* Using [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) instead of `$http`
* [Refactoring reusable Services out of Controllers](http://j.mp/1uYDs39)

I also showed you some tools and concepts:

* [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) with [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org)
* [DataBase-as-a-Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_database) with [Firebase](http://firebase.com)
* [Authentication via OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity) with [Hello.js](http://adodson.com/hello.js/)

### Shaping up with Angular JS, Take 4

If you haven't completed the [_Shaping Up with Angular JS_ course on CodeSchool](http://j.mp/codeschool--angularjs), please do so. You should work through levels 3, 4, and 5 tonight. Play back through any levels that you still feel shaky about.

### Github Profile -- Restangular Edition

Refactor [your Github Profile assignment](http://j.mp/1uYIiNP) to use Angular JS and specifically [the Restangular library](http://github.com/mgonto/restangular) instead of the `$http` service. If you're feeling intrepid, use `hello.js` to add a "Login with Github" button that updates the UI for the logged-in user.

### Real-Time Comments

Refactor [your Github Comments assignment](http://j.mp/1uYJfFQ) to use [Firebase](http://firebase.com) via [the AngularFire library](http://angularfire.com), instead of the Github API. You'll need to create your own (FREE!) account, and I recommend following [the Angular _Quickstart_ tutorial](http://j.mp/1uYK6q1), [the longer AngularFire tutorial](http://j.mp/1uYKnJx), and reading some of [the Firebase Hosting documentation](http://j.mp/1uYKFQO). You could drop your improved commenting app onto your blog for _awesome real-time comments_! Kinda like [Disqus](http://disqus.com)... Kinda.

### Build me something... interesting.

In small groups of 3 or 4, use all the tools in your toolbox to build something... interesting. Invent something. You should use at least 2 [public or authenticated data APIs](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/master/Notes/APIs.md). Please write User Stories, write them down, and estimate them. Commit frequently using the `git-flow` methodology. This is _practice_ for your final projects.
