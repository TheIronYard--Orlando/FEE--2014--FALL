### Review

Today we (very briefly) saw what Angular JS can do through some simple built-in Directives: `ng-app`, `ng-controller`, `ng-repeat`, `ng-model`, `ng-dblclick`, and `ng-class`. I was able to add some significant functionality to the TodoMVC template with just [a few lines of JavaScript](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/Dojos/2014-11-17/js/app.js) and [some simple HTML attributes](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/Dojos/2014-11-17/index.html). We also used [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) for the first time and saw how awesome that can be.

### [Shaping Up with Angular JS](http://j.mp/codeschool--angularjs)

Today for homework, I want you to all speed-read through the _Shaping Up with Angular JS_ course from Code School... _Don't try to work through the exercises yourself_, just buy the answers and type them into the submission boxes. When you complete the course, use Skitch to take a screenshot and add it to HipChat _and_ your WIP issue for today.

### Read the Docs, Luke!

There are _lots_ of bits and pieces in Angular JS, and you'll want to be familiar with an increasing number of them throughout the week. Start documenting them like we did with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS:

* Using [the API documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/), document the following parts of the framework; include the arguments, the return value, and an example of each in use:
  * function
    * `angular.module` -- returns an instance of _type_ `angular.Module`, which you should also document
    * `angular.extends`
    * `angular.copy`
    * `angular.element`
  * directive -- keep in mind that some directives can only be used on specific HTML elements!
    * `ngApp`
    * `ngBind`
    * `ngClass`
    * `ngClick`
    * `ngController`
    * `ngDblclick`
    * `ngForm`
    * `ngKeyup`
    * `ngModel`
    * `ngRepeat`
    * `ngSubmit`

### Angularize Me

If you're really bored and have time on your hands, try adding Angular to one or more of your old assignments. Don't get hung up on it if you don't make progress; there will be _plenty_ to do this week.
