### [It's The Final Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jK-NcRmVcw)

Congratulations! You made it! The official lecture of the program is now officially complete, and it's time to go gangbusters on your final projects. I can't wait to see what you'll build! Before you get started, though, here are some points about logistics.

#### Here's how this will work...

You'll organize yourselves around project teams [Startup Weekend style](http://vimeo.com/28872840). Everyone who wants to gets 1 minute -- exactly 60 seconds -- to pitch their idea to the group. Include a name (which can change), _your name_, the basic [elevator pitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch), any technical direction, and what you lack to execute. After the pitches, everyone gets 3 votes that they can place on one or more of those ideas, helping choose the projects that _everyone_ will work on. You're free (and encouraged) to ask clarifying questions of the founders or even abandon your own idea because you like someone else's better.

After the voting, Susanna, Brian, and I will select the top 3 or 4 projects based on votes and feasibility. Once we announce the winners, it's time to start dating! As the pitching founder, you have to convince others to participate in your crazy idea, and each team can only have 3 members. Time to practice some diplomacy!
