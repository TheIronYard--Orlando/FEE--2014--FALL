### Review

Today we reviewed the assigments from the weekend by building them together in class. We looked at positioning elements vs floating them, using the `before` and `after` pseudo-elements to add decoration to our markup, and how to fetch and alter elements on the page using the JavaScript DOM API. We built working implementations of the Vertical Timeline and Nested Accordion projects for reference.

### Assignment

**Catch up already!** There's no excuse not to have working examples of all three projects. Read about the pieces we used in class: CSS rules and selectors, HTML tags and attributes, and JS functionality. Document them so that you understand them. Find and create examples to reinforce their usage.
