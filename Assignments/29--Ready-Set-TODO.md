### Review

Today we reviewed everyone's Responsive Image Slider and saw a bunch more jQuery. We met our new friends [Bower](http://bower.io) and [wiredep](https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep), added some more gulp tasks, and built [our own version of the Responsive Image Slider](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2014--FALL/blob/Dojos/2014-11-12/index.html) in class with jQuery event soup. :D

### Hello, [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com)!

The TodoMVC project aims to produce a [reference implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation) of a well-defined, easily understood application with various JavaScript [MVC Frameworks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) and other toolkits. In your teams, starting with [the TodoMVC template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/template), break down the application, discuss roles and possible implementation. Tomorrow we'll work through some of the setup together.
