* [ ] Learning to read JavaScript...
  * Review your forked Open Source project for the vocabulary and punctuation that we reviewed in class today:
    * Numbers: Integers (`1`, `10`, `1000`) and Floats (`1.5`, `3.1415967`)
    * Booleans: `true` or `false`
    * Strings: `"Words inside of quotes"` / `'single quotes, too'`
  * Document your findings...
    * [ ] Ensure you're on the `master` branch, create a new branch for this assignment named `05--Reading-JavaScript`
    * [ ] Create a file in your `TIY-Asignments` repository called `Reading-JavaScript.md`
    * [ ] For every occurrance of our reading terms, provide a code block like the example below describing what you've found.
    * [ ] Make sure you have at least 10, but the more the merrier.
* [ ] Laying the ground work for local development...
  * [ ] Install [Homebrew Package Manager](http://brew.sh)
  * [ ] With `brew` install the `nvm` package (and follow all the instructions): `brew install nvm`
  * [ ] With `nvm` install the latest release of Node JS: `nvm install 0.10`
  * [ ] Select the version of `node` to use with `nvm use 0.10`
  * [ ] Ensure that `which node` returns the program installed by `nvm`.
  * [ ] Ensure that `node --version` works as expected.
* **Extra Credit:** Install [Atom](http://atom.io); bonus points if you can install via `brew`...!

### Reading Javascript

Surround your code with code fences (backticks) and use the name `javascript` to tell Github to color it like JavaScript (I only put the spaces in the example so that Github doesn't get confused within this document):

<pre><code>
```javascript
var count = 0;
```
 
* Variable: `count`
* Value: Number 0
 
~~~
 
```javascript
count = count + 1;
```
 
* Operators: `=`, `+`
* Variable `count` is `1`...?
</code></pre>

As above, write a couple of bullets describing the code that you identify: type, operators, etc... whatever you can identify. You should find at least 10 examples, but don't stop there. Ask for help in identifying pieces you don't understand yet, and go back to Code School for more instruction.
